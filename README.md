# [Project 1: Amidst Us.java - The Among Us Spinoff](https://github.com/CodesterEvans/AmidstUs)

The majority of the skills are demonstrated in the RedAstronaut and BlueAstronaut files. The Gameplay file is the driver and is where the code is tested. Use the instructions file to check if the answers in Gameplay are correct (they are). 

### Skills Demonstrated
1. Object Oriented Programming in Java: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
2. Superclass (abstract parent) and subclasses (concrete child) extentions implememented.
3. Super keyword: Constructors, and methods. @Override implemented.
4. Abstract class (parent) and abstract methods implemented concretely in child classes. Parent class methods referenced and utilized.
5. Interfaces implemented in two classes.
6. Java Arrays: Array reconstruction, appending, removing, indexing, filtering an array based on a variable.
7. Private variables used with getters and setters for encapsulation and security. 
8. Problem solving skills and programming fluency demonstrated with loops, conditionals, counts, array indexing manipulation, and print statements.
9. Driver file to run tests and simulate Amidst Us gameplay.

# [Project 2: PondStory.java](https://github.com/CodesterEvans/PondStory.java)
A story of frogs, flys, and life on the pond.

Initial commit of the Pond Project. The Pond.java file is the driver and where the story takes place. Fly and Frog are used as classes that interact in the pond.java file. Instructions are provided in a docx. 

### Skills demonstrated:

Ability to follow instructions;

Setting the private static variables for all Frog instances from the Pond class using a public setter method from the Frog class;

Object Oriented Programming: Use of public class, private and static variables, setters, getters, various methods, classes, overloaded constructors, overloaded methods.

Problem Solving: While statement, if/else statements, counters, and conditionals used in combination to create methods that perform interactive functions between objects/instances of classes. Heavy use of print statements to evaluate code mid-code demonstrating good programming practices.

# [Project 3: Battleship_Game.java](https://github.com/CodesterEvans/Battleship_Game)
A digitized version of the classic board game battleship. Two Player game played in the terminal. Users place their ships on a grid board and then fire at their opponents to sink all their battleships.

On the game board, '@' is a ship that has not been hit, '-' is a space that has not been fired upon yet, 'O' is a space where the user has shot but missed, and 'X' is a spot where the user has hit. The game terminates after the program detects that one of the users has no ships left and prints to the terminal that the game is over and which specific player has won the game!

### Skills Demonstrated/Description:
I completed the battleship application which can be viewed in a separate repositiory. This involved the use of switch statements for input validation, along with plenty of data type conversions such as str->int, a nested do-while loop to count the remaining number of ships represented by the '@' character in a multi-dimensional char[][] array, use of the split function to split a string into an array that will be used as the location board for ships as well as the target tracking board to keep track of user hits and misses on the 5 x 5 playing grid. The highest dimenisional array used here was a 3 dimensional char array used to store both players' game boards.

*Rules*
1. Enter coordinates as number 0-4 separated by a space. For example: 4 4 
2. Loser does 5 push-ups.
