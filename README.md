# AmidstUs

##[Project 1: The Among Us Spinoff](https://github.com/CodesterEvans/AmidstUs)

The majority of the skills are demonstrated in the RedAstronaut and BlueAstronaut files. The Gameplay file is the driver and is where the code is tested. Use the instructions file to check if the answers in Gameplay are correct (they are). 

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Object Oriented Programming in Java: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
2. Superclass (abstract parent) and subclasses (concrete child) extentions implememented.
3. Super keyword: Constructors, and methods. @Override implemented.
4. Abstract class (parent) and abstract methods implemented concretely in child classes. Parent class methods referenced and utilized.
5. Interfaces implemented in two classes.
6. Java Arrays: Array reconstruction, appending, removing, indexing, filtering an array based on a variable.
7. Private variables used with getters and setters for encapsulation and security. 
8. Problem solving skills and programming fluency demonstrated with loops, conditionals, counts, array indexing manipulation, and print statements.
9. Driver file to run tests and simulate Amidst Us gameplay.
